                <p>My favorite baseball team is the Los Angeles Dodgers. I grew up going to games at Dodger Stadium, I always enjoy going to games with my family. Basically my whole family from my dad's side are Dodger fans.</p>
                <p>My Grandpa, dad, uncle, and brothers are all Dodger fans so, it is cool being able to talk to them about something that we are all very passionate about.</p>

                <p>My favorite players right now on the Dodgers are Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts. There are a lot of great players on the Dodgers but these two are the best players on the team.</p>
                <p>Some other notable players that I like are Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, Tyler Glasnow and Clayton Kershaw who is one of the best pitchers of all time.</p>
                <p>My favorite player growing up was probably Adrián González. We traded for him in 2012 and he played with the dodgers until 2017.</p>
