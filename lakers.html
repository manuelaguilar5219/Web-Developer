                <p>My favorite Basketball team is the Los Angeles Lakers. Me, my dad, and my brother are all Laker fans so we all watch a lot of basketball. One of my other Brothers is a Suns fan because he likes Kevin Durant so I think that's a little weird but I still like to talk to him about basketball.</p>

                <p>My favorite players right now on the Lakers are LeBron James and Anthony Davis. This could be LeBron's last year but I hope he doesn't retire.</p>
                <p>Also you can't mention the Lakers without Kobe Bryant. He was the Greatest Laker ever and he is greatly missed by everybody.</p>

                <p>Basketball is probably my second favorite sport but I think it's really close between basketball and football but I have watched basketball longer so I will give it the edge.</p>
